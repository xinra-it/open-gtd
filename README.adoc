OpenGTD is free open source software for _getting things done_!

## Setup for development

This is a monorepo managed with https://lernajs.io[Lerna]. Sub-modules are located in `packages/`. The `lerna bootstrap` command installs dependencies of all sub-modules and creates symlinks for dependencies between sub-modules.

    npm install
    npx lerna bootstrap

NOTE: The following commands can either be run at the project root to affect all sub-modules or individually inside of each sub-module. Note that there are inter-module dependencies. If you want to build/start the client or server individually, you first have to build all shared modules.

### Run the application

    npm start

Server listens at http://localhost:3001

Client is accessible at http://localhost:3000

This will also watch for changes in the sources of the module(s) and automatically re-compile.

### Verify changes before commiting

Run tests:

    npm test

Run linters:

    npm run lint

Try to automatically fix linting issues:

    npm run fix

Run tests and linters:

NOTE: Always run this before submitting a pull-request. If this command does't complete successfully, a pull-request cannot be merged.

    npm run verify
